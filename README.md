# larval-navigation-circuits
This repository contains code, data, and analysis pipelines for decoding the neural circuits underlying navigation behavior in Drosophila larvae. We employ automated tracking (idtracker.ai), optogenetics, and chemogenetics to map the neural mechanisms of spatial orientation and decision-making.
